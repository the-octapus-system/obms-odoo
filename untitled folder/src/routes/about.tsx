          <p>Octapus exists to take complicated technology, remove the noise, and arrange it into one controlled business system.</p>
          <p>
            We partner with founders and operators who have outgrown disconnected tools. Instead of adding another SaaS to the stack, we design the operating layer that the business actually needs — and we operate it with you.
